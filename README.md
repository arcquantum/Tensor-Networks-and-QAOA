# Tensor Networks and QAOA: Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits

This repository houses all materials related to the classical simulation of quantum circuits using Tensor Networks, as of now with a specific focus on Matrix Product States (MPS) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA).

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **[Codes](Codes)**: Contains all Python source code developed for implementing MPS functionalities, gate applications, and QAOA simulation routines.
- **[Guidebooks](Guidebooks)**: Contains personal notes, theoretical guides, and other supplementary documentation created during the project.
- **[Reports and Presentations](Reports%20and%20Presentations)**: Stores the on-site internship report (PDF) and presentation slides (PDF).
- **[Results](Results)**: Holds all generated plots and data from the simulations, which are visualized and discussed in the dedicated results overview.

For a detailed overview of the project, including key results and future outlook, please see the [Project Details & Results document](results.md).
