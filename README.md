\# Tensor Networks and QAOA: Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits


This repository houses all materials related to the classical simulation of quantum circuits using Tensor Networks, as of now with a specific focus on Matrix Product States (MPS) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA).



It is organized into the following directories:



\*   \*\*`Codes/`\*\*: Contains all Python source code developed for implementing MPS functionalities, gate applications, and QAOA simulation routines.

\*   \*\*`Guidebooks/`\*\*: Contains personal notes, theoretical guides, and other supplementary documentation created during the project.

\*   \*\*`Reports and Presentations/`\*\*: Stores the on-site internship report (PDF) and presentation slides (PDF).

\*   \*\*`Results/`\*\*: Holds all generated plots and data from the simulations, which are visualized and discussed in the dedicated results overview.



For a detailed overview of the project, including key results and future outlook, please see the \*\*\[Project Details \& Results document](results.md)\*\*.
